Write a function called next_prime that takes a scalar positive integer input n. Use a while-loop to find and return k, the smallest prime number that is greater than n. Feel free to use the built-in isprime function. Here are some example runs:
```
>> next_prime(2)
ans =
     3
>> next_prime(8)
ans =
    11
>> next_prime(12345678)
ans =
    12345701
```

### Funci√≥n
```
function k = next_prime(n)
    % Initialize k to the next integer after n
    k = n + 1;
    
    % Use a while-loop to find the next prime number
    while ~isprime(k)
        k = k + 1;
    end
end
```
